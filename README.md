This project includes a step-by-step guide on how to exploit the Metasploitable3 machines (both Windows and Ubuntu)

In order for that project to be completed, the following were required:

1. The Metasploitable3 VMs (can be downloaded from: https://shorturl.at/lCKOV)
2. A Kali VM, which will be used in order to exploit the vulnerable machines.
3. A trial subscription on the Nessus platform (corporate or university email is required to do so)

The "Metasploitable3-Exploit.pdf" file includes the whole step-by-step process of the exploitation, while the rest of the files include the output of the scans (2 for each machine).

The goal was to attack to both of the machines 6 times in total. Also, some more general questions and answers regarding pentest are included.

**Note:** this repository includes a greek version of the project.

Feel free to contact for questions and comments.
